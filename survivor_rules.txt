Figuring out Survivor Pool

Grid
?

Teams
  -32
  -Every team will have a line/odds each week
  -figure out whether the line is more precise or odds
  -create a list (possibly a hash) for each team's week (k) and odds (v)
  -if a team is selected, it has to then be "invisible" for every other week

Scraping
  -Find the odds online projected for the whole season
  -Scrape the games and lines
    -that'll leave you with 18 lists (one for each week)

Moving on...
  -now theres 32 lists/hashes (one for each team)
  -OR now theres 18 lists (one for each week)
  -OR now theres 1 list. If its one set i think you can run through more effectively.
    -one list/hash that contains matchup/week/odds.
      - {teamweek: odds}
      - i.e. {PHL3: -350} == Week 3 Eagles Odds
        - Possibly want to add home/away info to hash? in case of a tie
          - {PHL3(H): -350}
      - Every key is unique
      - Loop exactly 18 times. Check for the greatest value, then see if anything matches it.
        -If its all alone, we're going to remove every other option in the hash that matches on the week, and matches on the team. Then go to the next loop and do it again
          -If the team matches itself for a different week, probably want to choose the earlier week?

          -If the week matches itself, multiple teams have the best odds.

Prioritization
  -if two teams have the same odds, which do you pick?
  -can we create different routes when odds are close?
  -we should prefer games with greater odds at the beginning compared to the end

Coming back After Long Break
  -Considering rewriting parts in Python since web scraping will factor in heavily
  -previous system might have worked, but concept was flawed because updated odds do not come midseason
  -To start, I'm going to focus on collecting several variables over a timespan (2000-2023): 
    1. Weekly Power Ranking, which focus on intangibles and are derived from past performance (from at least 2 sources[espn, nfl, etc.])
    2. Weekly Home vs Away game, which should impact future game outcome but would be separate from past Power Ranking
    3. Weekly Game Outcome
  -By collecting these three data points for each of the 32 teams in the NFL over a 20+ year span, I should be able to create a likelihood score of a future game outcome
  -other important variables to track if possible:
    1. playoff implications of game
    2. divisional vs non divisional matchup
    3. primetime game vs non primetime (collect date)
    4. Weather for game
