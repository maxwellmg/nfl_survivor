But Rhule's future likely is tied to how the winner of the quarterback competition performs. Without a consistent quarterback, Rhule's first two teams have gone 5-11 and 5-12. So in reality, they're all on the hot seat, but Rhule has the most to lose because he signed a <a href="/nfl/story/_/id/28439690/sources-baylor-matt-rhule-panthers-next-coach-gets-7-year-60-million-deal">seven-year, $62 million contract</a> in 2020. If this year's team falters, he could become the lastest coach to fail to make the transition from college to the NFL. -- <em>David Newton</em></p><hr><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/nyj.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="31"><h2>30. <a href="/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets">New York Jets</a></h2><p><a name="HOU"></a></p><p><strong>Post-draft ranking:</strong> 29<img alt="" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/sportsnation/rd-arrow.png"></p><p><strong>Who's on the hot seat:</strong> WR <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4035403/denzel-mims">Denzel Mims</a></p><p>Since taking Mims in the second round of the 2020 draft, the Jets signed <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3042778/corey-davis">Corey Davis</a> to a big contract and used two premium draft picks on receivers -- <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4372414/elijah-moore">Elijah Moore</a> (second round, 2021) and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4569618/garrett-wilson">Garrett Wilson</a> (first, 2022). Get the picture? Mims, drafted by the previous coaching staff, hasn't been embraced by the current staff. He's no better than the fifth or sixth receiver on the depth chart. Barring a dramatic turnaround, Mims could be playing elsewhere this season.

And while Mills had an impressive rookie year considering the turmoil he was surrounded by, with 16 touchdowns in 11 starts, he must significantly build on it. He has to prove there's no question he's the <a href="/nfl/insider/story/_/id/34384201/how-trevor-lawrence-zach-wilson-trey-lance-justin-fields-mac-jones-davis-mills-improved-second-year-qb-scouting-reports-next" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Texans' long-term answer</a> because the organization has two first round picks in the 2023 NFL draft.
